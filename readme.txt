font-resizer allows the visitors of your website to change the content font size

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to give the visitors of your site the option to change the font size.
The plugin acts over jQuery and saves the settings in a cookie. So the visitor see the same font size if they revisit your site.
Which content is going resized, the resize steps and other options you can set on the admin page called "font-resizer".

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `font-resizer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin directly with the 'Install' function in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the sidebar widget through the 'Design' menu in WordPress
1. If you would not use the widget, you can use the tag `&lt;?php if(function_exists('fontResizer_place')) { fontResizer_place(); } ?&gt;` somewhere
1. Define which content should be resized on the 'font-resizer' admin page (optional). If you are not familiar with html and css, select the body option (default). This would resize each content of your page.

== Screenshots ==
